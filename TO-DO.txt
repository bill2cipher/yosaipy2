refactor ValueError to TypeError for None checks

RememberMe cookies:
    - require an expiration date on the cookie itself
    - require tracking in a persistent datastore (nonce id , expiration date)
      so that absolute timeout checking can be performed


---------------------------------------------------------------------

refactor method overloading, cleanly separating collection vs scalar arguments

create a SimpleAuthorizer, which maintains only ONE authorizing realm

within the ModularAuthorizer, keep a mapping in memory between identifier and realm

a sessionexecutor raises expired session events, which are received by the
Authorizer and then relayed to the realm to clear cache

an expired session clears authorization and session cache

a refreshed authorization cache is one that replaces an invalidated authorization cache
and has a TTL that is in synch with the user's session

=---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

Packaging
-----------------
1) move dependencies to setup.py  (ex:  https://github.com/kislyuk/signxml/pull/37)
2) create a pypi compatible README as it doesnt handle markup

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

remove the logging level checks -- not necessary in python

PEP8 standardized imports:
    First group:  import stdlib modules
    Second group:  third party libs
    Third group: modules from yosai

synchronize imperative and declarative authz examples:

RunAs ought to emit an event, to help audit administrative work
